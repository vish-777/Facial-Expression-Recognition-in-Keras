# Facial-Expression-Recognition-in-Keras

Four objectives are as follows:

1) Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras.

2) Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN).

3)Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask.

4)Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data.
